## bitwise operations

### >> (right shift)
- shift all bits to the right
- one shift means /2 (divided by two)
- example 24 >> 1 = 12

### << (left shift)
- shift all bits to the left
- one shift means *2 (multiply by two)
- example 24 << 1 = 48

### ~ (NOT)
- compare two bit sequences with the same length
- every 1 becomes a 0 and vice versa
- example:  ~ 0 1 1 1
            = 1 0 0 0

### & (AND)
- compare two bit sequences with the same length
- if both bits are 1, the result is 1 otherwise it is 0
- example:    0 1 0 1
            & 0 0 1 1
            = 0 0 0 1
            
### | (OR)
- compare two bit sequences with the same length
- if both bits are 0, the result is 0 otherwise it is 
- example:    0 1 0 1
            & 0 0 1 1
            = 0 1 1 1

### ^ (XOR - exclusive OR)
- compare two bit sequences with the same length
- the result is 1 if both bits differ, 0 if they are the same 
- example:    0 1 0 1
            & 0 0 1 1
            = 0 1 1 0
